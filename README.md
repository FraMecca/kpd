# kpd-client
This is a rewrite for an mpd client called kpd (Kyuss Music Player, python_old branch)
It is very similar to mpc in functionality but the with a more efficent and less strict search.

~~It requires python-musicpd module to run, install it with pip~~
It now uses [libmpdclient](https://www.musicpd.org/libs/libmpdclient/)

## Usage
---

```
make
sudo make install
```

you can run the client on your console.
At the first run you will be prompted for the configuration file (.kpd.conf on your home).

Here is an example:

```
db = /home/user/.mpd/database
host = localhost
port = 6600
```

The client has a set of commands that can be explored using `kpd --help`:

```
usage: kpd [-h] [-p [PLAY]] [--pause [PAUSE]] [-n] [-ps] [--stop]
           [--random [RANDOM]] [-u] [-a] [-s [SEARCH]]

           [--single [SINGLE]] [--swap SWAP SWAP]
           [--format FORMAT [FORMAT ...]] [--output] [--no-output]
           [--search-mode [SEARCH_MODE]]

optional arguments:

                        from shell
  -s [SEARCH], --search [SEARCH]
                        search a string in the database, casi insensitive
  -f FILTER [FILTER ...], --filter FILTER [FILTER ...]
                        filter search result, can use 'artist', 'album',
                        'title', grep like functionality
  -vf NO_FILTER [NO_FILTER ...], --no-filter NO_FILTER [NO_FILTER ...]
                        filter search result excluding matching, can use
                        'artist', 'album', 'title', grep -n like functionality
  --clear               clear playlist
  -pl, --playlist       show playlist

                        change display format, write 'kpd --format help' for
                        usage
  --output              print output on screen, default enabled
  --no-output           do not print output on screen
  --search-mode [SEARCH_MODE]
                        switch search mode: options are 'mpd' (mpd database
                        lookup) or 'pickle' (pickle lib serial database,
                        faster)
```

The arguments are evaluated in the exact order they are written in the console.

## Search
---
One of the principal feature is the search.
The search accepts only one string and is case insensitive.
The search can be narrowed using the _filter_ option.
Example:

```
$ kpd --search kyuss -f queen
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1995) ...and the Circus Leaves Town/09 Size Queen.flac
Kyuss Discography/EPs, Singles, & Splits/(1997) Kyuss - Queens of the Stone Age/01 Into the Void.flac
Kyuss Discography/EPs, Singles, & Splits/(1997) Kyuss - Queens of the Stone Age/02 Fatso Forgotso.flac
Kyuss Discography/EPs, Singles, & Splits/(1997) Kyuss - Queens of the Stone Age/03 Fatso Forgotso Phase II (Flip the Phase).flac
Kyuss Discography/EPs, Singles, & Splits/(1997) Kyuss - Queens of the Stone Age/04 If Only Everything.flac
Kyuss Discography/EPs, Singles, & Splits/(1997) Kyuss - Queens of the Stone Age/05 Born to Hula.flac
Kyuss Discography/EPs, Singles, & Splits/(1997) Kyuss - Queens of the Stone Age/06 Spiders and Vinegaroons.flac
```

```
$ kpd --search kyuss -f queen album circus
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1995) ...and the Circus Leaves Town/09 Size Queen.flac
```

```
$ kpd --search valley -f artist kyuss -nf conan water
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1994) Welcome to Sky Valley/01 Gardenia.flac
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1994) Welcome to Sky Valley/02 Asteroid.flac
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1994) Welcome to Sky Valley/03 Supa Scoopa and Mighty Scoop.flac
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1994) Welcome to Sky Valley/04 100Â°.flac
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1994) Welcome to Sky Valley/05 Space Cadet.flac
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1994) Welcome to Sky Valley/06 Demon Cleaner.flac
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1994) Welcome to Sky Valley/07 Odyssey.flac
Kyuss Discography/Albums/(1994) Welcome to Sky Valley/09 N.O..flac
```

The filter nd no-filterflag is case insensitive and accepts _artist, album, title_ option parameters.
Actually the filter flag has grep like functionality so it can filter the search on any parameters, symbols or file extensions included.

### Search Methods
The search method has been rewritten in C in a simplier way: it just looks inside the gzipped default mpd database.
The search is way less strict: case-insensitive, no type field.

### Add result
The result of the search can be added to the playlist with `--add` or `-a` arguments. kpd can also be used in a pipe like this:

```
$ kpd -s kyuss -f queen hula | kpd -a
```
